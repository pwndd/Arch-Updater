# Arch-Updater
A very simple bash script to update your arch system.

-Make sure to run ***cd /downloads/updater.sh*** or the directory you downloaded the file. Then, run ***ls***. If you can see the ***updater.sh*** file listed, you're good. Then, run ***chmod +x updater.sh***. Now, do ***sudo ./updater.sh*** and you're good to go!
